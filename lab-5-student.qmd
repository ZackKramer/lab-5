For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

### Tips 

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.


## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-crime-scene-report

crime_scene_report |>
  filter(date == 20180115, 
         type == "murder",
         city == "SQL City")

```

Last house on Northwestern Dr, Annabel on Franklin Ave

**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
Hint: Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-witnesses-interviews

person |>
  filter(address_street_name %in% c("Northwestern Dr",
                                    "Franklin Ave"),
         str_detect(name, pattern = "Annabel") | address_number == max(address_number, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  inner_join(interview,
            by = join_by(id == person_id))

```

The suspect is a Get Fit Now member with ID 48Z, was working out on Jan 9, and has a car w/ license plate that includes H42W. 

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-gym-members-cars

get_fit_now_member |>
  inner_join(get_fit_now_check_in,
             by = join_by(id == membership_id)) |>
  left_join(person,
             by = join_by(person_id == id)) |>
  left_join(drivers_license,
             by = join_by(license_id == id)) |>
  filter(str_detect(id, pattern = "48Z"),
         check_in_date == 20180109,
         str_detect(plate_number, pattern = "H42W")) |>
  pull(name.x)

```

## And the final suspect is...
